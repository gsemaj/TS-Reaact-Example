# TypeScript + Fluent UI React Sandbox
Super basic environment for you to start messing around with TypeScript + Fluent UI React.
## Build Instructions
First, make sure you have Node.js installed; you can grab the LTS installer from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it.
Once that's done, open the folder you cloned/downloaded with VSCode, and open a terminal (through the Terminal button on the toolbar).
Once you're in there, run
```
npm init
```
which will install all the dependencies.
After that, run
```
npm start
```
and the sample app should open in your browser! Now you can mess with it from within VSCode.
